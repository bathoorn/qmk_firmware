# The einnor's split right layout

I created this layout so i could use two ymbk_np21's as a split planck.

For me the right part of a split np21 setup has the usb connection on the left side.
So when having two connected the usb connectors will be in the middle between the keyboards.
This is because i like to have my modifiers in the middle and not on the sides of the keyboard.

The layers i use are as follows

- Qwerty layout layer is the base layer
- Shift layer so i can redefine some shift behaviour
- Number layer
- Symbol layer
- Navigation keypad layer
- Backlight LED layer

Note that the left side is defined in the split_default keymap for the ymdk_np21
